# parkfield-statistics

In this statistical inference project, I am exploring the earthquakes in Parkfield, California.
Parkfield lies along the San Andreas Fault, one of the longest and most active faults in the United States. 
Here in this project I am analyzing the magnituds and the timings of when the earthquekes happen.
The data set is taken from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/livedata.php
